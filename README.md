# HTML5 Canvas 2D Island Generator
A small project to play with the HTML5 canvas element and practise JavaScript, view the final page [here!](https://rawgit.com/pmccolgan/HTML5-Canvas-2D-Island-Generator/master/canvas.html)

The html page explains it better than this but in a nutshell it randomly populates a small grid that looks a bit like an island, the cells can be edited and a second view puts a character in a cell who can walk about.
